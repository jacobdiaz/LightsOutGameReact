Lights Out is an electronic game released by Tiger Electronics in 1995. The game consists of a 5 by 5 grid of lights. When the game starts, a random number or a stored pattern of these lights is switched on. Pressing any of the lights will toggle it and the adjacent lights. The goal of the game is to turn every light on the entire board to the "On" state. This arcade game was create using the React Js framework. This project was created as a way to practice newly learned knowledge about the React State paradigm along with making making a fun arcade game.
